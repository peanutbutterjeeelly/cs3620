# Operating Systems  
## Assignment 1  
#### Problem 1  
Given a binary input file with a known structure (4-byte key + 96-byte value), sort the records in the fastest possible time. This solution was second fastest in the class.  
#### Problem 2  
Develop a big integer addition implementation similar to that used in Java's BigInteger class.  
#### Problem 3  
Develop a big integer multiplication implementation similar to that used in Java's BigInteger class.  
#### Problem 4  
Implement the typical binary tree operations in C.  

## Assignment 2  
Develop a basic shell application.  

## Assignment 3  
Write a scheduler that uses the following three algorithms: first come first serve, shortest job first, and shortest time to completion first. Report the response time and turnaround time metrics using the test files provided.  

## Assignment 4  
Use the paging-linear-translate.py to answer the questions about memory translation.  

## Assignment 5  
Design a multi-threaded solution to find the nearest neighbors to each of the data points in the query file compared to each of the points in the data file. Report the time taken.  

## Assignment 6  
Implement a password manager program using the OpenSSL encryption library.
