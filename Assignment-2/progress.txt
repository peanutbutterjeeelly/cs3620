To Do: 
-> (done) Background jobs
-> white space ('mysh> ls > a', should work the same as 'mysh> ls>a')
-> double check error messages are all good

Complete:
-> all of the built in commands are working (I think wait() is working, but hard to know)
-> redirection works
-> python feature
-> batch mode is working
