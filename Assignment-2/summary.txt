This project was completed by Bryan Ehlers and Sydney Garcia for the Operating
Systems course at University of Iowa taught by Professor Omar Chowdhury. 

The project consisted of developing a simple shell using the C language that 
had the following features:
-> Can run 'normal' commands (cd, ls, etc...)
-> Can redirect the output to a file
-> Can implement functions such as wait and cd by syscalls
-> Can run a python program by calling 'program.py'

Although we worked together and helped each other debug throughout, Bryan worked
mostly on the parsing, wait/cd commands, and output redirection. Sydney worked
mostly on the python program feature and setting up the structure to run the 
normal commands through execvp() function.
