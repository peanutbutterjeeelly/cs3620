As the address space increases, the size of the page table also increases proportionally. A 2MB address space will have a page table twice as large as a 1MB address space would have.

As the page size increases, the size of the page table has an inverse proportional relationship. A 2KB page size will have a page table that is half the size of a 1KB page size.

We shouldn't just use really big pages in general because internal segmentation will become an issue. That is where segmentation will occur within each of the pages as they grow in size.
